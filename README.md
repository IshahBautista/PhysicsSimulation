# PhysicsSimulation

Hello everyone! So this is the code for the physics simulation game.

!! IMPORTANT !!
For the code to actually work in ur game, you need to follow these instructions:
> Download ALL the files and place them in ONE folder
> Inside the folder containing the files, make a new folder named ASSETS, it has to be exactly ASSETS
> Inside ASSETS, place all the .png images linked in the google drive
> please DO NOT change any of the file names as that will mess with the code
> https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19sCJdZKBdVnaTegzUsxVv3EJgcofa5eQ

Updates
>> I have managed to fully finish the Simulation Portion of the Game including the optics and the values displayed
>> Most of the Assets can stay as is but we need a BG for the front page - I havent added the animations for the doggy yet doe 
>> We might or might not make a game depending on the time and feasability but the simulation itself is done

Questions you might ask:
> Why are the values so large??
>> I had to change the code to be one to one ang number of pixels, and calculations in meters - this was because having them
>> be converted causing some serious issues in the calculations. However, even tho the numbers are so large, they should be
>> approximately correct as best as can be. I'm looking for a way to decrease the max distance by changing the pixel to meter
>> ratio but as of now kana sa. The max distance is currently a little over 940m, thus the numbers should be quite large.

> Will the box in the input be there sa final? (Its ugly asf fr fr)
>> No, dle lang ko kabalo saon pag tanggal hehe figure out pa nako later lol :3

> What else can I do?
>> Review the code, check for bugs, and make sure that everything works as they should, also pls check if the values
>> in the simulation line up with the actual calculations.
